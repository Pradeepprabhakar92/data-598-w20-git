We are using the Starwars dataset, which has `r dim(starwars)[1]` rows and `r dim(starwars)[2]` columns.


```{r, starwars-plot,fig.cap = "A ggplot of starwars stuff"}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human")%>% ggplot()+aes(x=height,y=mass)+geom_point()
```

We can see in Figure \@ref(fig:starwars-plot) a linear relationship between the height and mass of the starwars characters.


```{r starwars-tbl}
starwars%>%
  filter(species == "Human")%>%
  select(name,height,mass,homeworld)%>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "A knitr kable table of starwars data")

```

We can see the height, mass and home world of various starwars characters in Table \@ref(tab:starwars-tbl)


```{r, starwars-img, fig.cap = "Star wars IV cover"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVlY2MwMjktM2E4OS00Y2Y3LWE3ZjctYzhkZGM3YzA1ZWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SY1000_CR0,0,643,1000_AL_.jpg")

```

The classic poster for the Star wars: Episode IV movie as seen above in Figure \@ref(fig:starwars-img)
